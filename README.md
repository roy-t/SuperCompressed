# SuperCompressedDotNet
A .NET wrapper for BinomialLLC's Basis Universal Supercompressed GPU Texture Codec. Which is located here: https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal.

The goal of this project is to provide a single NuGet packages that allows x64 C# projects to use the Basis Universal encoder and transcoder.

Very much a work-in-progress. 

## Notes
When pulling the latest version of Basis Universal in the `src/external/basis_universal` submodule folder. Make sure to double check any new/renamed/removed files are present in `src/external/basisu_lib.vcxproj`
